# AI-Skola — Prototype

AI-Skola is a simple prototype for an education platform that combines learning content, performance statistics, and AI-powered assistance in one place. It's an early startup prototype that demonstrates how education, analytics, and AI can work together to improve learning.

## Overview
This website is a lightweight prototype of an education platform. It brings together courses and lessons, assessment tracking, and analytics, with AI features that help learners get personalized guidance and insights into their progress.

## What it has
- Course pages with lessons and learning content
- Quizzes and assessments to measure progress
- Learner progress tracking (per-user progress and completion)
- Analytics dashboards and statistics (performance over time, completion rates)
- AI-powered features (personalized recommendations, feedback, and study suggestions)
- Simple admin/content management for creating or editing material
- Prototype-focused code and examples (not a production-ready system)

## What it does
- Lets learners study course material and take quizzes
- Collects performance data and shows visual statistics
- Uses AI to suggest next steps, personalized content, and feedback
- Gives instructors or admins quick insight into learner progress and course health

## How it works (high level)
1. Users sign up / log in and enroll in courses.
2. Learners go through lessons and complete quizzes or exercises.
3. The platform records results and usage data.
4. Analytics process the data and show dashboards and reports.
5. AI components analyze learner performance and generate recommendations or feedback to personalize learning paths.
